# Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game that became a phenomenon for its addictive gameplay and simple, yet challenging mechanics. The game revolves around navigating a bird through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen to make the bird 'flap' and avoid the obstacles.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply click or tap on the screen to make the bird fly upwards. The bird will naturally fall due to gravity, so you must continuously tap the screen to keep the bird in flight. Avoid hitting the ground or any of the pipes that appear as obstacles. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible to achieve a high score.
